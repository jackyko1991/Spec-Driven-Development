# üåü Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Workflow

[ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá](README.zh-Hant.md)

This document outlines the **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)** workflow, a structured approach for building software with agentic development tools like Claude Code, AWS Kiro, and Roo Code. SDD divides the development process into three distinct phases: **Steering Architect**, **Planning**, and **Execution**. This separation of concerns promotes rapid, high-quality code generation with enhanced clarity, maintainability, and traceability.

## üöÄ SDD Workflow Overview

The SDD workflow consists of three sequential phases:

1.  **üß≠ Steering Architect Mode**: Define the project's high-level rules, product vision, technology stack, and overall structure.
2.  **üóÇÔ∏è Planning Mode**: Collaboratively create detailed feature specifications, including requirements, design documents, and actionable tasks.
3.  **‚ö° Execution Mode**: Implement the defined tasks atomically, verify their correctness, and incrementally update the codebase and documentations.
4.  **üêû Debugger Mode**: A structured workflow to identify, replicate, and fix bugs in an isolated sandbox environment.

Each phase is supported by specialized agentic tools and context files, which enforce coding discipline and minimize ambiguity throughout the development lifecycle.

```

## 1. üß≠ Steering Architect Mode

**Responsibilities:**
- Analyze the existing codebase (if any) to establish a baseline.
- Generate or update foundational rule files (e.g., in an `.ai-rules/` directory).
- Document the product vision, technology stack, folder structure, and project-level architectural rules. This now includes establishing conventions for unit testing and development sandboxes (local folder or Git worktree).

**Artifacts:**
- `.ai-rules/product.md`: Describes the product's purpose, features, and target audience.
- `.ai-rules/tech.md`: Specifies the programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and testing strategies to be used.
- `.ai-rules/structure.md`: Defines the project's directory layout, file organization, and sandbox environment conventions.

### Development and Debugging Sandboxes

To ensure a clean and isolated development environment, the Steering Architect establishes conventions for using sandboxes. A sandbox is a temporary, isolated environment where new features can be developed or bugs can be fixed without affecting the main codebase. This practice is crucial for parallel development and maintaining stability.

The agent will ask about two types of sandboxes:
-   **Development Sandbox**: For building new features. The options are typically a local `sandbox/` folder or a more advanced Git worktree.
-   **Debugging Sandbox**: A dedicated space (e.g., a `debug/` folder) for isolating bug fixes.

These choices are documented in `.ai-rules/structure.md`, and the corresponding folders are added to `.gitignore` to keep the main repository clean.

## 2. üóÇÔ∏è Planning Mode

**Steps:**
- **Define Requirements**: Elicit and document requirements using methods like user stories, scenarios, or EARS (Event-Action-Response-State).
- **Design Solution**: Create high-level designs for modules, APIs, and interaction sequences.
- **Break Down Tasks**: Decompose the design into small, manageable tasks and analyze their dependencies.

**Spec Folder Structure:**
A dedicated folder is created for each feature to hold its specifications:
```text
specs/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-name/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.md
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design.md
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md
```

**Collaborative Refinement:**
Engage in a dialogue with the AI agent to refine and clarify ideas. The agent should ask targeted questions (typically 3-5 per feature) to move from broad concepts to precise specifications, ensuring the resulting spec files are comprehensive and clear.

## 3. ‚ö° Execution Mode

In Execution Mode, the agent functions as a focused coding assistant. It systematically reads the `tasks.md` file and generates incremental code changes with a strong emphasis on **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** to ensure functionality and reliability. The agent adheres to agile DevOps practices, delivering small, verifiable improvements that align with project requirements and maintain high code quality. It also handles documentation updates, ensuring that code and documentation remain synchronized.

### Detailed Workflow:
1.  **Identify Task**: Open `tasks.md` and select the first unchecked (`[ ]`) task.
2.  **Understand Task**: Read the task description and refer to the corresponding `design.md` and `requirements.md` for full context.
3.  **Implement & Document**: Apply a single, atomic code change to address only the current task. As you code, update relevant documentation (e.g., inline comments, user guides, API docs).
4.  **Verify**: Follow the acceptance criteria or testing instructions defined in the task.
5.  **Reflect**: Document any project-wide learnings or newly established patterns in the "Rules & Tips" to ensure consistency.
6.  **Update State**:
    - If an automated test passes, mark the task as complete: `[x]`.
    - If verification is manual or no test exists, summarize the changes and ask the user to confirm functionality (unless running in autonomous mode). Upon confirmation, mark the task as `[x]`.
    - Summarize all changes in a development log, such as `./dev-log/<yyyymmdd>.md`.
    - After a major tasks complete, run any documentation build commands if applicable.

### Parallel Feature Development:
Features can be developed in parallel, while tasks within each feature are executed sequentially. This enables efficient collaboration and faster delivery.

## 4. üêû Debugger Mode

When a bug is identified during the **Execution Mode**, the SDD workflow provides a seamless transition to the **Debugger Mode**. This mode is designed to provide a safe and structured environment for bug resolution, ensuring that fixes are tested in isolation before being merged into the main codebase.

### Key Features:
- **Isolation**: Bugs are replicated in a minimal, sandboxed environment (either a configured sandbox or a temporary `.ai_debug/` folder) to prevent any impact on the main development work.
- **Two-Tiered Strategy**: Offers both **Atomic Function Testing** (using TDD) for isolated bugs and **System Integration Debugging** for more complex issues.
- **User-Centric Verification**: The agent collaborates with the user to verify that the fix resolves the original bug without introducing new ones.
- **Seamless Workflow Integration**: After a bug is fixed and merged, the agent prompts to switch back to the **Execution Mode** to continue with the next task, ensuring a smooth development cycle.

### The Execution-Debug Cycle: A Pendulum Approach

Our SDD workflow introduces a "pendulum" or "boomerang" development cycle between the **Execution** and **Debugger** modes, designed for rapid and stable feature development in progressive mode.

The cycle works as follows:
1.  **Execute**: The `task-executor` agent implements a significant, planned task from the `tasks.md` file.
2.  **Verify**: Upon completion, the agent presents the changes to the user for verification.
3.  **Debug (if needed)**: If the user identifies a bug, the workflow seamlessly transitions to the `debugger` agent. The bug is then isolated, replicated, and fixed in a safe sandbox environment.
4.  **Return**: Once the bug is resolved and the fix is merged, the `debugger` agent offers to switch back to the `task-executor`.
5.  **Continue**: The `task-executor` picks up the next task, continuing the development momentum.

This iterative process ensures that each piece of implemented functionality is validated before moving on, creating a tight feedback loop that builds robust and reliable features quickly.
